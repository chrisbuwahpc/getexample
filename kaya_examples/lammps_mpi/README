# with GNU Environment.
# 
# lammps is an MPI code that runs on 2 nodes or more
# with 24 MPI tasks on each node.
# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks
# and the number of MPI tasks per node.
# We also need to change the compiler from Cray to GNU
# to be able to run this code with GNU Environment.
# We need to load the module lammps
# This information is located under lammps_mpi_gnu.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs lammps_mpi_gnu.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 2 nodes (--nodes=2)
# To compile hello_mpi.c with GNU, we change the compiler
# from Cray to GNU as shown below:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
# We then load the lammps module as shown
module load lammps 
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 48 MPI tasks (-n 48)
# with 24 tasks per node (-N 24)
# If the number of nodes changes, the N is 24 
# multiplied by number of nodes given
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like:
# aprun -n 48 -N 24 $EXECUTABLE < epm2.lmp >> ${OUTPUT}


# To submit the job to Magnus
jobid=$(sbatch --parsible lammps_mpi_gnu.slurm)
